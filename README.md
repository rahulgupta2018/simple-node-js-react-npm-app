This repository is for the Build a Node.js and React app with npm tutorial in the Jenkins User Documentation.

The repository contains a simple Node.js and Express application which generates a web page with the content "Hello From Jenkins" and is accompanied by a test to check that the application renders satisfactorily.

The jenkins directory contains an example of the Jenkinsfile (i.e. Pipeline) you'll be creating yourself during the tutorial and the scripts subdirectory contains shell scripts with commands that are executed when Jenkins processes the "Test" and "Deliver" stages of your Pipeline.
